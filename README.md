# RPS-Python-Game-
Rock Paper Scissor Game Project with PyGame, Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV

An AI to play the Rock Paper Scissors game
Dataset can be trained by ourself
 
## Requirements
- Python 3
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV

## Set up
1. Install the dependencies
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Gather Images for each shape (rock, paper and scissors and None):
```sh
$ python3 gather_images.py <shape> <number>
```
3. Train the model
```sh
$ train.py
```

5. Test the model
```sh
$ test.py <path_to_test_image>
```

6. Play the game with your computer!
```sh
$ python3 play.py
```
